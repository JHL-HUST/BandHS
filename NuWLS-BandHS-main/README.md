# NuWLS-BandHS
Incorporating Multi-armed Bandit with Local Search for MaxSAT
----
This repository contains the code of the NuWLS-BandHS algorithm for the MaxSAT proposed in our paper: <br> <br>
[Incorporating Multi-armed Bandit with Local Search for MaxSAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16011) <br>
Jiongzhi Zheng, Kun He, Jianrong Zhou, Yan Jin, Chu-Min Li, Felip Manyà <br> <br>

Installation
----
On a Unix/Linux machine execute the following commands: <br> <br>

cd NuWLS-BandHS-main <br>
make <br> <br>

An executable file called NuWLS-BandHS will now be available in the directory NuWLS-BandHS-main. <br>
Then enter the command ./NuWLS-BandHS instance_name, to run the algorithm. <br> <br>
